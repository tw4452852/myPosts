* 

Until now I have worked for about 4 years. And I have mainly worked as a
platform driver engineer and I'm interested in how software control the hardware
devices. I have experience with many devices, such as i2c, NIC, or some buses,
e.g. PCIE. So I've used language C mainly and is familiar with linux.
I use it everyday for work. Especially, I'm interested in Linux kernel and read
some source code about it. This help me know some details of some mechanism and
also learn some good ideas from them.

Just 2 years ago, I encountered golang and fell in love with it soon, I dig some
its internal and write some posts about them on my blog.
Also I have write some tools with golang (e.g. my blog's storage system,
translation tool, my X11 window manager) and I have given some contributions to some open source
project(e.g. golang tool repository, revel, caddy ...). If you are interested in
them, look at my github.
I think golang is brilliant language, it is very productive.

Now I expect work with golang everyday and use it in the real productions,
So I'm looking for a golang related job and joining the Toptal Software programmers network.

FIN.
