     MaxStartups
             Specifies the maximum number of concurrent unauthenticated connections to the SSH
             daemon.  Additional connections will be dropped until authentication succeeds or
             the LoginGraceTime expires for a connection.  The default is 10:30:100.

             Alternatively, random early drop can be enabled by specifying the three colon sepa‐
             rated values “start:rate:full” (e.g. "10:30:60").  sshd(8) will refuse connection
             attempts with a probability of “rate/100” (30%) if there are currently “start” (10)
             unauthenticated connections.  The probability increases linearly and all connection
             attempts are refused if the number of unauthenticated connections reaches “full”
             (60).
